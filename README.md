Hey There! Welcome to my personal website. I created this website about 6 months ago, hoping to learn a little about HTML and CSS. Currently, I am creating a new website, with an updated look. I will try to make it live whenever possible. All in all, this was my first professional website, and it was an interesting learning experience.
